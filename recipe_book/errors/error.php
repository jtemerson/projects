<!--	If you are going to require specific requirements of a password, tell people 
        up front, not after the fact, it ticks them off. Also, make all fields, other
        than password, sticky. (Name is not on your registration form). The forms
        will not allow me to register. Your feedback never says anything about not
        allowing special characters. It will also not accept "Cit12345". Cereal,
        not cerial. Category List page loses header with navigation links. Also,
        logout landing page loses the header. Nice idea and it is obvious that 
        you have put some work into this. Just some communications issues and delivery 
        issues to clean up.-->
